PHP has an array variable exploit when using the $_GET method

Read more about it here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1885979/php-get-variable-array-injection

Basically, I can set execute arbitrary code when using arrays. In this case, I'll make name equal to password.

Below is the link:
http://52.10.107.64:8001/?name[]=1&password[]=$name

name is 1 and password is $name, which aren't equal. When getting the sha1, PHP evaluates the statements and produces the same hash to get by the second check.
