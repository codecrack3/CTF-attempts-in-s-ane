  (Note that we guessed the username is "secret")
ssh -v -i key -l secret 104.131.124.226 -p 22 | less

> Since the server instantaneously closes the shell after connection and appears
  to print out nothing, we have to capture the output, so we'll use less(or
  strings) to print out the output that we are given. An additional reason we
  need to do this is because the server prints out control characters to hide
  the output after the connection closes.

> Sifting through the output, we find the link http://cl.ly/image/2c2a3O1T3q3j/
  which gives us an image!
