First do:
sudo apt-get install quelcom sox

Next use wget:
 
wget http://adctf2014.katsudon.org/dat/tcaBjvZbWEAKfsGB/listen.wav

Use qwavinfo in package quelcom to find out what is wrong:

qwavinfo listen.wav 
listen.wav: header value error
1 file (1 error) => 0:00

We have a header error. Use qwavheaderdump in package quelcom to find out the issue with the header:

$ qwavheaderdump -F listen.wav 
listen.wav (328310 bytes):
	riff: 'RIFF'
	riff length: 328302
	wave: 'WAVE'
	fmt: 'fmt '
	fmt length: 16
	format: 1
	channels: 1
	sample rate: 1
		sample rate field should be between 8000 and 48000
		don't know which value must be set...

	bytes/second: 44100
	bytes/sample: 2
	bits/sample: 16
	data: 'data'
	data length: 328266

Use the sox command to change the sample rate to 32 kHz:

sox -r 32000 listen.wav -r 32000 listen-32.wav 

Open listen-32.wav in a music player and you get the flag:

The flag is in all capital letters: ADCTF_SOUNDS_GOOD
